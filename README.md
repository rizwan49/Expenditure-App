# Expenditure-App
This app will show your daily expenditure based on month wise with graphical representation. Basically it's read from your phone message and store it into local db using Room persistence and show it to you. 

# Steps:
1. Reads all the SMS on the person's phone. 
2. From the SMS, detecting which have come from banks. 
3. And using those, finding total spending per month by that person. 
4. Representing these spends by months and days, using histograms. 
5. Used my imagination for UI/UX.  
6. Used MVVM design pattern.
